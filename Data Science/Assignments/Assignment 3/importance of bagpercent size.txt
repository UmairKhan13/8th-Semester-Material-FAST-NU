Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregation) is used when our goal is to reduce the variance of a decision tree.
 Here idea is to create several subsets of data from training sample chosen randomly with replacement. 
 Now, each collection of subset data is used to train their decision trees.
 As a result, we end up with an ensemble of different models. 
 Average of all the predictions from different trees are used which is more robust than a single decision tree.
